turkiBot-ExtBoard-API
=====================

an group of source code for drive turkiBotExt board for raspberry pi

Connecting line to GPIO of rapsberrypi is painful, so the board is created to remove the pain and make programmer control the motor without soldering and confusing on GPIO.
It JUST works after you insert the raspberry pi into the board.

Only python code is provided now, lua code is on our road map. No plan for c or c++ code, it is really painful.
